## Adam-Running-Report-Power-BI
I'm working on a Power BI report that showcases my running data. The purpose of this report is to not only show my running data, but also try new things in Power BI. Please feel free to download and use the resources for your own report.

Sample Data

| RunID | Date      | Time    | Day of Week | Distance | Run Time | Avg pace | Fastest Pace | Calories | Elevation Gain | Elevation Loss | Elevation | Avg Heart Rate | Max Heart Rate | Cadence | Shoe ID | Where | Temp | Age | State | City
| ----- |:---------:| -------:| -----------:| --------:| --------:| --------:| ------------:| --------:| --------------:| --------------:| ---------:| ------------:| ------------:|------------:| ------------:| ------------:| ------------:| ------------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 1     | 12/1/2023 | 6:56 AM |      Monday |      4.2 |     39:43|    12.36 |        10.23 |      530 |             234|              34|       3943|             145|             178| 11.34 | 1 | Road | 65 | 37 | Washington | Seattle |


I would like to break out each run by mile and capture the pace, average heart heart rate. 

#
## Goals 

 I would like to create monthly and yearly goes based on miles ran, calories, and # of runs. Create visuals based around these goals similar to the Apple rings in the fitness app. 

After I have visuals set up with the goals I would like to show how far I am and call to action for me to reach the goal. Show some element such as "Need to run X amount of miles in the next X amount of days to reach goal."

An example of goals. 
- January 100 Miles
- January 10,000 Calories Burned 
- January 15 Runs 
- 2023 1200 Miles 
- 2023 150,000 Calories Burned 
- 2023 130 Runs

## Overall Stats

This page should show the following metrics. 

- Total Runs All Time
- Total Miles All Time
- Total Run Time All Time
- Total Calories All Time
- Average Pace All Time
- Average Heart Rate All Time
- Average Max Heart Rate All Time
- Average Cadence All Time
- Average Distance Per Run All Time

Show Heart Rate over the current year by month. 
Show Max Heart Rate over the current year by Month

Break out each mile and show the average pace, heart rate, cadence such as mile 1,2,3,4, etc. Count only full miles run only. 


#
## Locations 

This page would show what state, city, elevation I ran in. Also, show breakout of Treadmill, Road, Trail, etc. 

Could possily show a map of the US and be able to display which city I ran in there. Show the other basic stats like elevation, heart rate, pace, etc.
